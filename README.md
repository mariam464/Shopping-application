## Technologies & Skills

- **C#:** The primary programming language used.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implements principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
- **Generics:** Utilized for creating flexible and reusable code that works with different data types while maintaining type safety.
- **Collections:** Extensive use of C# collection types (e.g., `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`) to manage products, cart items, and wishlist items efficiently.
